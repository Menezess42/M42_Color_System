# M42_Color_System
App to do a series of image conversions requested by the computer graphics professor
-------
This code does:
- Manual binarization
- Manual equalization
- Manual conversion of:
  - RGB to HSI
  - RGB to CMY
  - HSI to RGB
- In (H)SI it allows increasing and decreasing by 10
- In HS(I) it allows increasing and decreasing by 10
-----
Over time I will update this readme, as well as create docstrings in code.
