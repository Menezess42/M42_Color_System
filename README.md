# M42_Color_System
App to do a series of image conversions requested by the computer graphics professor.
Over time I will update this readme, as well as create docstrings in code.
-------
Features:
- Manual binarization
- Manual equalization
- Manual conversion of:
  - RGB to HSI
  - RGB to CMY
  - HSI to RGB
- In (H)SI it allows increasing and decreasing by 10
- In HS(I) it allows increasing and decreasing by 10
- You can hover your mouse over the image on the left or right, and below it will show the RGB, HSI and CMY values for the pixel that the mouse is hovering over. It displays the values of both images below them so that you can compare them.
